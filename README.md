                                    Welcome to our Arcade by Maurin LIBERAL and Tristan Mesurolle.



                To Start just use make and launch ./arcade.
                The arcade will automatically launch Nibbler our first game with SDL2 graphic lib.
                If you wish to change the graphic lib use 'l' for the previous one and 'm' for the next one'.
                And to switch between Nibbler and Pacman use 'b' and 'n'.
                To Play both games :
                    You have to use ZQSD keys to move and if you want to have a little boost use SPACE key.

                For Nibbler:
                    The "boost" is a bonus/malus. You move faster and get more point but it's easier for you to bump into a wall :p.
                    When you take an apple you get one point without the bonus and 5 points with it.
                    When the nibbler eats an apple his tail grow up between 1 and 3 blocks randomly.

                For Pacman:
                    The boost just help you to escape from ghost like in the native game.
                    If one ghost eats you the game closes itself and if you get all apples you win !

                After losing or winning you have to enter your name and you will see the best score !

                To quit the game with ncurses use 'w' key.


                The other group we are working with is the group of "alexis1.crapet@epitech.eu and matteo.da-costa-goncalves@epitech.eu"

                                                        
                                                        HAVE FUN !
